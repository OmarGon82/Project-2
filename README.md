# Project-2
This is my second project for the Team Treehouse Full Stack Javascript Tech Degree. 
For this project we used pagination to divide a long list of students into multiple pages and and created buttons to be able to navigate through those pages. As an added bonus I added a search feature so that you could search the list of student and those results would also be paginated and there were no students matching the search input then a message would dislay letting you no that no students matched your search. This project was completed using vanilla javascript.
