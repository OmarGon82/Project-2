# Project-2
This is my second project for the Team Treehouse Full Stack Javascript Tech Degree. 
For this project, I used pagination to divide a long list of students into multiple pages and created buttons to be able to navigate through those pages. As an added bonus I added a search function and the results are also paginated and there are no students matching the search input then a message will display letting you know that no students matched your search. This project was completed using vanilla javascript.
